## FAQ

Q: My badge doesn't work on battery, not even after puting the switch on BAT and holding E-Boot

A: The battery contact on the bottom of the battery clip has to contact the side of the battery. If you pressed in the battery instead of rotating it in, you'll have squashed the contacts. How to fix this:

1. Remove the battery
2. Carefully bend the bottom contacts vertical again
3. Press the battery against the bottom contact and then push it into place on the top
